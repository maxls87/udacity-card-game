			<p>Wombats are short-legged, muscular quadrupedal marsupials that are native to Australia. They are adaptable and habitat tolerant, and are found in forested, mountainous, and heathland areas of south-eastern Australia, including Tasmania, as well as an isolated patch of about 300 ha (740 acres) in Epping Forest National Park in central Queensland.</p>
